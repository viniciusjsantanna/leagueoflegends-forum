#greenhouse Docs
This is an example of MEAN application where you can manage a store of cute plants.
Mongo DB + Express JS + Angular JS + Node JS - Full Stack Javascript

#DEMO page
greenhouse is hosted at Heroku - https://radiant-sands-19039.herokuapp.com

#How can i test greenhouse?
To run it locally, just clone green house repository

`git clone git://github.com/marcoshmendes/greenhouse.git`

After clone, it's time to install all dependencies from node in your prompt.

`npm install`

After installing all node modules. Just run it using nodemon module.

`nodemon`

You rock dude! It's running on 

`localhost:8088`

The Data base is hosted at https://mlab.com/, feel free to change it for your local mongoDB and test as you want.

##What we have till now?
In this version of code we have two Node services being consumed by Angular. It is: GET All plants, and POST to save new plants in the store. At add page we have a cute and useful image selector with pre configured plant images. Let's try it on, plants are being saved at a Mongo DB hosted by https://mlab.com/.

##greenhouse API
Yeah! After built our cute node routes, let's distribute our services to others developers. Let's try greenhouse api https://radiant-sands-19039.herokuapp.com/api

##Next Steps
i'm going to make a search field in the home page for search plants by its price, name and code purchase. The page of checkout is the main objective right now, where you can buy a cute plant and receive details about your test purchase on your email. I'm also intend to create an area of management of plants, like DELETE items, edit and a upload photos from your computer.

###Advise - At Development
This app isn't complete yet, i'll post the code little by little. Updated at 18/04/2016
